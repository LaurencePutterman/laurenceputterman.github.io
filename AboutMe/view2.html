            <p>Despite having no formal design training, I appreciate the importance of good design in a product.
            There's something amazing about picking something up and understanding intuitively how it's used by virtue of its design.</p>
            This is what I strive for. For this reason, I enjoy working with designers and having the opportunity to learn from their work.
